 * Problem Definition:
 * We have a knapsack of capacity weight C (a positive integer) and n types of objects.
 * Each object of the ith type has weight wi and profit pi (all wi and all pi are positive
 * integers, i = 0, 1, â€¦, n-1). There are *unlimited* supplies of each type of objects. Find
 * the largest total profit of any set of the objects that fits in the knapsack.
 * <p>

 * Some notes: Profit = 0 when either capacity or number of objects is 0.
